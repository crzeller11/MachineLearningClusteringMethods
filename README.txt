README Documentation: Project 1
-------------------------------

- Before beginning, you will need to import the swiss_banknote data as a numerical array.
    - To do this, go to HOME tab, click "Import Data," and once the window appears, double-click 
      the "swiss_banknote" file. 
    - Once in the file, select columns 2-6, and make sure "Numeric Matrix" is selected. Then you
      can click the green checkmark above "import selection"
    - The numeric "swissbanknote" should now be saved in your workspace as a 200x6 double
- Once this has been imported, you can run the experiment
    - To do this, proceed to RUN_ME.m and run the script.
    - Running this script will produce 12 different graphs, don't be alarmed! Each one is labeled
      with a title describing what it shows. The legends will also help.
    - Running this scrip will also save 18 variables in the workspace, all of these correspond
      to the rates of error and in some cases, centroid assignments.
